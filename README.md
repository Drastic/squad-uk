# SQuAD-uk
## A large scale dataset for Question Answering in Ukrainian

[SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/explore/1.1/dev/) [Rajpurkar et al. 2016]  is a large scale dataset for training of question answering systems on factoid questions. 
It contains more than 100,000 question-answer pairs about passages from 536 articles chosen from various domains of Wikipedia. 

**SQuAD-uk** is derived from the SQuAD dataset and it is obtained through semi-automatic translation of the SQuAD dataset 
into Ukrainian. It represents a large-scale dataset for open question answering processes on factoid questions in Ukrainian. 
**The dataset contains more than 60,000 question/answer pairs derived from the original English dataset.** The dataset is training set to support the replicability of the benchmarking of QA systems:

* `squad-train-v1.1-uk-mini.json`: it contains training examples derived from the original SQuAD 1.1 trainig material.
